#Open Trustee
The open trustee is a fully democratized consortium of persons who are interested and invested in the future of open source projects and communities. The Open Trustee acts as a trust for open source projects to prevent the common addage of un-maintained and highly used projects.

It's often said that when a project dies you can just "fork it" but there's a lot of other variable involved in this process from things like external package managers to automated builds which aren't easily replicatable.

This is mitigated by providing the Open Trustee with full ownership access on all related accounts to your project allowing the Open Trustee to takeover the project in your absense and continue your good work.

The Open Trustee is governed by its members and follows a strict constitution ensuring that the God-mode privileges afforded to the Open Trustee are only enacted with the utmost care.

Members are typically owners of their own projects, who contribute of $0.99c per year to have their own projects under the stewardship of the Open Trustee. This fee is nominal and is simply there to cover the costings of running the Open Trustee and its servers.
